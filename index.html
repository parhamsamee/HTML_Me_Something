                    <p> Our adventure first started by flying into Glacier Park International Airport. 
                        We got in pretty late and headed to a hotel for the night before going to our cabin the next morning.</p>

                    <h3> DAY ONE </h3>
                    <p> Our first day in Hungry Horse, Montana included finding our way to our AirBnb. 
                        The Airbnb was a beautiful cabin along the riverside. 
                        The view everyday was phenomimal. It was such a peaceful place. </p>

                    <p> The second day brought us to the Garden of One Thousand Buddhas and the Garnet Ghost Town. 
                        However, before we could arrive to our destination we had to trade out our rental car for a truck 
                        because it ended up snowing about 6 inches. </p>

                    <h3> DAY THREE</h3>
                    <p> Our final day we went to Glacier National Park. Driving on the roads was a bit rough since none of the roads were cleared. 
                        However, we safely made it to our destination and did a 2 mile hike in the snow to get to Avalanche Lake. </p>

                    <p> We enjoyed our time at Glacier National Park and hope to go back one day when the eastern side of the park is open. </p>
